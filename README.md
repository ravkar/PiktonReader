=============
What is Pikton? - like photons/electrons are particles transporting light/electricity, then so called piktons (e.g. QR, DM codes) are carriers transporting digitally secured/encrypted information.

This project is focusing on building low cost, fast, 2D scanner suited for reading form mobile phone displays. 
The scanner is very well suited as component used in Enterprise Integration Patterns based integrations.
